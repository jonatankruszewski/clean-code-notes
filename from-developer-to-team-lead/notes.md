## Hiring

- Interviewing: interest challenge.
- Limited amount of time: communication, technical level, motivated.
- 3 main factors: Technical level, motivation: how much effort are they willing to invest?, intelligence: how deeply the understanding is regarding tasks, technologies.
- Screening:
  - A - Phone interview.
    - Ask abstract questions regarding their technologies.
    - 5 minutes.
    - Good understanding + Good communication: next step: a face to face interview.
  - Face to face Interview
    - 1. Make them feel comfortable.
    - 2. Introduce the workplace.
      - The team, the technologies, the role.
      - How the sprint is built.
      - How tickets get to production, how testing is done, how business is done.
    - 3. Tell me about yourself.
    - 4. Tell me about a challenge you had.
      - Try to understand the nuances, the level of familiarity.
    - 5. Pay attention to terms usage
    - 6. Complex questions.
    - 7. Hands on exercise: often build a small quiz.
      - Check how did they wrote the code
      - How they solve problems.
      - Helps understand what value will their bring.

## Succesfully onboarding

- Feels as part of the team
- Knows where to find help when needed
- feels comfortable approaching you
- Are they accepted by the team? Does anyone feels undermined?

- Face to face conversation.
  - Expectations
  - Most important values
- Show them the place
  - Provide the Computer, etc
- introduce to the team
- Source code and understanding dive in.
- Assign someone to answer their questions
- Assign them a task (real or practice)
- Check in on them, one or twice a day.
  - Be aware
  - Decrease those checkins gradually
  - This fosters a sense of trust.

## Delivering effective feedback

Personal feedback.
- What they do well
- What they need to improve
- Every 3 / 6 months.

1. Gather data on the developers' work
   - Convert into insights.
   - Trying to remember creates a bad impression. Point down and bring the list. Increases the chances of constructive discussion
- Plan how to present what you have to say
  - Sandwich technique. Good + improvement + Good.
  - Frame positively
  - Connect with values
- Important points about criticism
  - Make sure the developer has tools to fix.
  - Get to the bottom of the problem.
- Have it Documented
  - Gives extra credibility

## Mentoring a Struggling developer

1. Identify the problem precisely.
2. Find what causes the problem.
3. Make them involved
4. find a solution
5. Workflow / methodology - build a process
   - Analyze their workflows
   - Set them specific goals
   - Trust them
   - Reflect to management (optional)

## Dismissing

- Make sure they understand the problem and its severity
- Is this something I am willing to accept?
- Have a meeting with them.
  - Send a copy of the documentation of the meeting to the relevant stakeholders
- Should I dismiss this person?
  - Cost-benefit consideration. Costs: what the company will have to pay, reduced productivity, time and effort to find and onboard a new developer, the chances that the new one won't be as good as the current one. Benefits: you will get someone else, who might be a better fit.
  - Moral/Cultural consideration.
  - Can it be fixed in a decent amount of time?
- Dismissal Meeting
  - Shouldn't be a surprise: they should be aware
  - Come prepared with facts. Talk about the oportunities given to improve.
  - It is nothing personal. Doesn't mean you won't succeed elsewhere. They might be a great fit for another team. Dismissal means that they don't fit the current team.
  - What they say - shouldn't change your mind. Don't get into arguments.
  - Don't argue. Inform.
  - It is final. Make sure they don't harm other team member's motivation. If needed, just send them home.

### Conclusion

- Your developers are biggest asset.
- Invest what it gets to have them at their best.
- Remember they are human beings needed to be treated with respect and empathy.
- 

## Changing the team's behaviour

- Have clear concepts about wanted / unwanted behaviours.
- Understand their motivations. You need that to influence them.

- Team values
- Motivation

Strategies:
- Setting the atmosphere
- Reinforce behaviors
- Setting boundaries

### Team values

- Have clear concepts about wanted / unwanted behaviors.

Some values
- Ownership
  - Commited to finishing on time
  - Resolve issues
  - Participate in planning
  - Take responsibility

- Team work
 - Share knowledge
 - Help one another
 - Discuss ideas
 - Solve conflicts

- Technical Excellence
  - High code level
  - Suggest libraries, etc
  - Improve team members' technical level.

- Transparency
  - Not hide failures
  - Shares opinions and criticism

- Continuous improvement
  - Current sprint better than previous
  - Always improve

Values might contradict at certain times.

### Understanding developers' motivation

- important to give them what they want.
- What motivates them, what aspires to.
- Understanding and answering their needs, the motivation to follow the leader will increase dramatically.
- To influence your team's behavior you need to understand their needs.
- Answering their needs.

Five things most developers want:

- Autonomy.
  - Related value: ownership
  - Let them do it their way.
  - Don't get into the bits and bytes.
- Being an authority (of some part of the app)
  - Related value: ownership
  - Gives a sense of satisfaction
- Being appreciated.
- Having challenges
  - Continuous improvement, technically excellence
  - Interesting, hard to accomplish.
- Using new technologies and tools
  - Technical Excellence, team work.


### Setting the atmosphere

Changing the team's behavior in a subtle way.
Creating a pleasant atmosphere to increase team morale.

- Be positive
- Compliment more
- Avoid taking out frustration on your team
  - Take a short break,
  - Practice mindfullnes,
  - or whatever.

It will take some time until you see results.

A team fun to work with.

### Reinforcing behaviours

Positive and negative reinforcement.
Changing the team's behavior.

Encouraging good behaviors:
- Mention and compliment.
- Bring it up & talk about it
- Give a reward

Discourage undesirable bad behaviour:
- Consider team's culture
- Make them receptive to your message
- Make sure expectations and how to meet them, clear
- Be respectful
- Make them want to improve

Reward good clarify what to do instead when bad done.

### Setting Boundaries

- Developers can't and shouldn't dictate how to do things to any management.
- Open for discussion, but stating "we are not doing something" is unacceptable (for developers)
- You can set boundaries for anything that is not acceptable to you
- Does not necessarily mean speaking aggressively
- Boundaries should change behaviors

Abreu's red lines:

- No such a thing as "I / we won't do it" => "I trust you"
- No insult or offending other team members.
- Working hours
- Meeting attendance.

Allowing some personal time on work time as a boost satisfaction, as well as it is measured.

- Have clear boundaries in advance.
- When someone crosses the line. Start moderate, scalate as needed.

## Promoting Tasks


### Introduction

- Deciding whether or not to perform a task
- Analyzing tasks
- Time estimates
- Promoting Tasks within your team
- Code reviews

### Deciding whether or not to perform a task

- Refactoring
  - Rewrite
  - Planning the rewrite

  - New bugs?
  - Benefits:
  - Saved time for each future change
- Software upgrade
- Fixing exceptions that the user isn't aware of

### Analyzing tasks
- Risk assessment
- POC
- Have a plan
- Use others' experience
- Consult with someone in your firm

### Time estimates
Consider the role of estimations
Take some spart time
Develop trust
Agree how to translate hours into days
Understand that peoplpe otuside the team have no way of knowing how long something takes.

### Promoting tasks within the team

### Code review
- make sure that the person who performed the task undersstood what was requested
- Explain the flow
- Questions:
  - Is it the simplest way to solve the issue
  - Is it future compatible?
  - Is this code predictable
  
### Conclusion
- You are not expected to know everything

## Section 5 Productive Time management

### Introduction
### Moving in the right direction
- Efficiency: avoid waste
- Efficiency is important, but you can be 100% efficient without being meaningful.
- If you don't know where you want to go it doesn't matter which path you take.
 
- Guiding questions
  - How can you enhance collaboration and communication within your team
  - How can you enhance your code's quality
  - Which of your values can you promote and how
  - What actions can you take in order to reduce the number of critical bugs
  - What holds your developers back in terms of their productivy and how can you and your team solve these issues
  - Do your team members have the knowledge they need to accomplish their tasks
  - Where do you see your team in 1, 2, 3 years from now?
  - What will your team do better?
  - What technologies will you use?
  - How will each of your team members grow, and what additional responsibilities will they have?


### Optimizing Time Allocation
- Important vs Urgent.
- Prioritizing tasks.
- Important: gets closer to your goals
- Urgent: requires immediate attention.
- 

The vicious cycle of not prioritizing
- You are not sure what is important
- Everything seems important
- You try to handle everything
- You handle everything well, which makes people assign you more tasks
- You handle those tasks too, so you don't hae time to think what's important

### Time thieves

- Emails: things that you need to know, or to do.
  - Time cap them.
  - Very often NOT urgent.
  - Get rid of them as quickly as possible.

- Phone:
  - Schedule
  - Delegate
  - Postpone handling.

- Meetings:
  - Can someone else go instead?
  - Ask the organizer what is needed before the meeting.
  - Make the needed preparations beforehand.
  - Have a clear agenda.
  - Ask feedback before the meeting?
  - Make sure the meeting is focused.

- Team meeting:
  - Have a clear agenda
  - Send it by email.
  - Notify relevant team members specifically


The workshop

- Pay attention to how you treat other people.
- That is the most important thing about your job.
- It will last longer than when you leave.
